  "articleBody": "UTR Rating is a modified elo rating system that promotes fair and competitive play across the tennis world. Players are rated based on actual results, not age, gender, nationality, or socioeconomic status. </SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\">When you understand your skill level, you can find hits, events, and tournaments where you’ll have fun, play competitive tennis, and improve your game. All you need to know is your UTR Rating! </SPAN></P><HR/><P><SPAN style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG dir=\"ltr\">What is a</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; display: inline !important;\"><STRONG>UTR Rating</STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>? Why should I have one? </STRONG></SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\">UTR Rating is a number that provides a real and accurate measurement of skill level. A player’s UTR is a number between 1.00 and 16.50. </SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\">One match result is all it takes to receive a projected UTR Rating. After approximately five matches, the rating becomes fully reliable. As matches are played and entered into the system, a player’s UTR will increase or decrease over time as per the following methodology.</SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG>How is it calculated? </STRONG></SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\">For each match, the algorithm calculates a match rating and a match weight for each player. A player’s UTR Rating is the weighted average of up to 30 of their most recent match ratings. Only matches within the last 12 months count toward a player’s UTR. </SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG>Calculating Match Rating</STRONG></SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Two factors are considered when calculating the match rating. The first factor is the UTR Rating difference between opponents. The second factor is the competitiveness of the match, as determined by the percent of total games won.</SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Given the UTR Rating difference, the algorithm expects a certain percent of total games won. The player who performs better than the algorithm’s expectation will see their match rating go up while the other player’s match rating will go down. When one player’s match rating increases, the other player’s match rating decreases by the same amount. </SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Note: If the two players have a different number of matches counting toward their rating, the overall UTR Rating may not increase or decrease by the same amount.</SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG>Calculating Match Weight</STRONG></SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The following factors are used in the match weight calculation:</SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><EM>Format</EM> – As the match format increases in length, more weight is given. A match with a three-set format receives more weight than a match with an eight-game pro set format. </SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><EM>Competitiveness</EM> – As the UTR Rating difference between players increases, less weight is given. For example, imagine a player with a UTR of 6.00. A match played against an opponent with a UTR Rating of 5.00 or 7.00 receives more weight than a match played against an opponent with a UTR of 4.00 or 8.00.</SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><EM>Reliability </EM>– As the reliability of the opponent’s UTR Rating increases, more weight is given. A match played against an opponent who competes often and thus has a reliable UTR Rating receives more weight.</SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><EM>Time Degradation </EM>– As prior matches get older, less weight is given. Since the algorithm is a representation of the current form, it gives more credit to matches played within the last few months. </SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG>Ways to Improve Your </STRONG><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; display: inline !important;\"><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; display: inline !important;\"><STRONG>UTR Rating</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Play Well – Performing well in matches is the easiest way to improve your UTR Rating. If the match is out of hand, don’t give up! It does not matter whether you play higher- or lower-rated opponents; you can improve your UTR either way by winning more games than expected.</SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Play Often – The more matches you play, the quicker your UTR Rating will reflect your current form. The algorithm is especially accurate for those who play often against a variety of opponents rated above and below you.</SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Be Patient – Since your UTR Rating is a rolling weighted average, the effect of new results is slightly lagged. Your UTR Rating may not fully reflect a recent outcome right away, but it will over time.</SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\">If something seems off with your rating, please send us a note <A href=\"https://support.universaltennis.com/en/support/tickets/new\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</A>, and our team will review it.</SPAN></P><P dir=\"ltr\"><SPAN dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Our data scientists would love to hear your feedback.
